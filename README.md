### 🐋 with Docker


First install Docker and Docker-compose and set it up.

Clone the repository navigate to
 ```bash
./RTRE/Server
```

### 🔥 Firestore Configuration
Create a [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwo_KXBhAaEiwA2RZ8hLe4oIrXEhwgYLuZdC5CjJ_NGgIsY9Ajb9lGdqry4v5eg_YZCc9JXBoC7tMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) Database and acquire the service acount key by generating it

 ```bash
 - Go to console
 - Add project
 - Build
 - Firestore Database (follow instructions)
 - Press the gear ⚙️ icon next To Project Overview
 - Project Settings -> Service accounts
 - Generate new private key and save that in ./Server 
```

navigate to ./RTRE and type the following;

>🔔  Make sure in server/fore/rtre/server/Main.java BimPort is set to docker.internal.host:port

```java

public class Main {
	 public static String BimPort = "http://host.docker.internal:8082";
	// public static String BimPort = "http://localhost:8082";

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Main.class, args);
	}
}

```

```bash
## build server, frontend and Bimserver images
> docker-compose up
```
After the process is done, should be when the springboot backend has started these are the following adresses at default:

+ Springboot - http://localhost:3030
+ Bimserver - http://localhost:8082
+ Client - http://localhost:8080
    - Default Admin username = admin@admin.com
    - Defauilt Admin password = password


## 🤖 Dev-Setup

### 🔒 Requirements

- Python 3.9
- JDK 8
- IfcOpenshell
- Bimserver
- Maven
- Node.js , npm
- Firestore

First installing the merge functionality, navigate to [IfcOpenshell](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/releases/tag/blenderbim-220817) repository and install the blendebim-py3.9 version

Copy the files from ./blenderbim/libs/site/packages/ and copy the 
```bash 
ifcpatch and ifcopenshell 
```
folders to python3.9 site-packages/dist-packages You can locate the site using the command:
```bash 
python -m site
```
You will also need to connect to a firebase Database, follow instructions in the section [firestore Configuration](#🔥-firestore-configuration)

Next, either install [Bimserver](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver/releases) from its repository version 1.5.182 Or the easier way trough a docker with image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/disitlab/bimserver/tags) 


```bash 
## pull image
docker pull disitlab/bimserver:1.5.182
## run bimserver on port 8082
docker run -p 8082:8080 disitlab/bimserver:1.5.182
```

Clone repository and navigate to ./RTRE/frontend/rtre-webbapplication/ and run commands

```bash 
## install modules
npm install
## run frontend Client
npm run serve
```


Next, navigate to ./RTRE/Server/ and run 

>🔔  Make sure in server/fore/rtre/server/Main.java BimPort is set to localhost:port 

```java

public class Main {
	// public static String BimPort = "http://host.docker.internal:8082";
	public static String BimPort = "http://localhost:8082";

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Main.class, args);
	}
}
