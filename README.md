## ‚ö° Quick-Setup
---
### üêã with Docker


First, install Docker and Docker-compose and set it up.

Download the zip file of repository
>üîî If you're cloning it make sure git config core.autocrlf is set to false
>  ```bash
> git config --list
> git config --global/--system/--local/--worktree core.autocrlf false
> ```

### üî• Firestore Configuration
>üîî you can also follow the instructions in the [wiki](https://github.com/therealtimerealestate/RTRE/wiki/Firestore-setup)

<br>

Create a [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwo_KXBhAaEiwA2RZ8hLe4oIrXEhwgYLuZdC5CjJ_NGgIsY9Ajb9lGdqry4v5eg_YZCc9JXBoC7tMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) Database and acquire the service account key by generating it

 ```bash
 - Go to the console
 - Add project
 - Build
 - Firestore Database (follow instructions)
 - Press the gear ‚öôÔ∏è icon next To Project Overview
 - Project Settings -> Service accounts
 - Generate a new private key 
 - save as "serviceAccountKey" in ./RTRE/Server
```
>üîî  Make sure before the following step this should be as standard if fresh clone
, in server/fore/rtre/server/Main.java BimPort is set to docker.internal.host:port

```java

public class Main {
	 public static String BimPort = "http://host.docker.internal:8082";
	// public static String BimPort = "http://localhost:8082";

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Main.class, args);
	}
}

``` 
navigate to ./RTRE and type the following;

```bash
## build server, frontend and Bimserver images
> docker-compose up
```
After the process is done, should be when the spring-boot backend has started these are the following addresses at default:

+ Springboot - http://localhost:3030
+ Bimserver - http://localhost:8082
+ Client - http://localhost:8080
    - Default Admin username = admin@admin.com
    - Default Admin password = password


## ü§ñ Dev-Setup
---
### üîí Requirements

- Python 3.9
- JDK 8
- IfcOpenshell
- Bimserver
- Maven
- Node.js
- npm
- Firestore

First installing the merge functionality, navigate to [IfcOpenshell](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/releases/tag/blenderbim-220817) repository and install the blenderbim-py3.9 version

Copy the files from ./blenderbim/libs/site/packages/ and copy the 
```bash 
ifcpatch and ifcopenshell 
```
folders to python3.9 site-packages/dist-packages You can locate the site using the command:
```bash 
python -m site
```

You will also need to connect to a firebase Database, follow instructions in the section [firestore Configuration](#---firestore-configuration)
>üîî you can also follow the instructions in the [wiki](https://github.com/therealtimerealestate/RTRE/wiki/Firestore-setup)

<br>

Next, either install [Bimserver](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver/releases) from its repository version 1.5.182 Or the easier way through docker with an image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/disitlab/bimserver/tags) 


```bash 
## pull image
docker pull disitlab/bimserver:1.5.182
## run bimserver on port 8082
docker run -p 8082:8080 disitlab/bimserver:1.5.182
```

Clone repository and navigate to ./RTRE/frontend/rtre-webbapplication/ and run commands

```bash 
## install modules
npm install
## run frontend Client
npm run serve
```
>üîî Make sure before the following step, in server/fore/rtre/server/Main.java BimPort is set to localhost:port 

```java

public class Main {
	// public static String BimPort = "http://host.docker.internal:8082";
	public static String BimPort = "http://localhost:8082";

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Main.class, args);
	}
}

```

Next, navigate to ./RTRE/Server/ and run 

```bash
